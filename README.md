# College-Employer-Analysis-and-Clustering
## Motivation
The goal of this project is to group together post-secondary institutions within the US from the perspective of an asipiring professor/instructor. The origin of this problem comes from the covid-19 epidemic hit schools hard at a time and many post-secondary professors began to retire or how they consider retiring from teaching to protect themselves and their family. From The Chronicle of Higher Education that 69% of professors felt stressed up from 32% pre covid, 68% up from 32% felt fatigued, which becomes a sustainability issue. 74% felt their work-life balance had completely deteriorated from the covid-19 epidemic and 55% of Faculty ar either retired or highly consider retiring, a staggering number that even I couldn't believe. What this made me think of was as the covid epidemic may calm down, there will be many openings for professors at universities, larger than the annual 169,000 openings. With that number constantly rising it would be in employment seekers favor to get an idea of what sort of institution they may be looking to work for.
